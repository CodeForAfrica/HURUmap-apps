# Dominion

Dominion gives journalist and civic activists useful facts and data about land ownership in Africa. Accessible at https://dominion.investigate.africa

## 🚀 Quick start: Dominion React Front End

Dominion has it's own react ui django app that serves some of its front-end component  [dominion_ui](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HURUmap-apps/tree/feature/set-up-dominion/dominion/dominion_ui). Therefore, to get started we will need to first build the ui before starting development or deployment of dominion  [HURUmap-app](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/HURUmap-apps/blob/master/README.md).

On your project root directly, run these commands to build dominion ui:

```
cd dominion
yarn
yarn build
```
